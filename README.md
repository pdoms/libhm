#LibHm

A simple Hashmap implementation in c. With linear probing and FVN-1a.
Credit goes fully to Ben Hoyt, who wrote this awesome tutorial: https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/.

I'm just beginning to program in C. Hence, I copied most of the code and tried to understand how this implementation of
the hashtable works. I also wanted to use it as a library in another project and finish the whole process.
